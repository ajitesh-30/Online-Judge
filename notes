TODO:
* sandbox for security, best option seems to be docker.
* celery worker if I want to make it at least a little efficient
* write code allowing the user to add a question
* work on the UI

Security:
    * Easiest is chroot, I think.
    * Docker is pretty easy also and better because chroot requires that
    the server runs as root which is not realistic.
    * There are other ways, SELinux and Apparmor but they seem difficult and time
    taking.

Tasks:
    * Need to automate the task mechanism.
    * Maybe have to make some changes in the Database structure as well.

UI:
    * Fix it.
    * Maybe use semantic, so that it looks cool.
